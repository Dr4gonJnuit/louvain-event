This is the group projet we have to do in the course of Projet d'approfondissement (LINFO1212)

How to launch the server :

It's pretty easy, launch your favorite shell (I personnaly use git Bash) and insert this command line :

node server.js

And voil√†, now go to https://localhost:8080 and you will see our site.
